# Social Physics - Data Analysis and Visualization
Societal and Cultural Data Analysis

Why is this here?

This is where I generate data vizualizations of all types of data. I was looking at metrics. I wanted to conveyy the information clearly and efficiently.

Over time this repository will reflect my efforts. This repo in its entirety is free and opensource. Some of the data and graphics / images are 

copyright by their owners. Where appropiate, I credit and or provide direct hyperlinks to the prospective owners copyrighted material.

This repo is exercise in data visualization. Subject matter is based soley on data availability and my preference or pursuits of interest.

Listed above are some tools and resources you can use to develop your own data analysis and visualizations. 

I will be adding to this repository as time allows. I have heard it said,“Without data, you're just another person with an opinion.”

Grab some data check it for accuracy against disparate, varied and multiple sources. Then have fun with datasci and dataviz as you inform 

yourself and others possibly. In the market place of ideas, arm yourself with facts and data processing techniques

and not rely solely on anecdotal opinion or social media. Maybe use Social physics, right? 

Cheers,

M.
